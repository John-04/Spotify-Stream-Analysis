# Spotify-Streaming-Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the performance and characteristics of songs in the context of a music streaming service. By examining key metrics such as streams, danceability, and valence, we aim to understand trends, patterns, and potential factors influencing a song's popularity.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset comprises information about various songs, including their track names, artists, release dates, and streaming metrics such as the number of streams. Additionally, danceability, valence, and other audio features provide a detailed profile of each song.

## Data Analysis:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

#### Descriptive Statistics:
The dataset encompasses a wide range of songs, with an average danceability of 66% and an average valence of 63%. Streams vary significantly, with a mean of 221 million streams.

### Feature Engineering:

To enhance our analysis, we introduced a new feature called 'interaction,' representing the product of danceability and valence. This feature aims to capture the combined effect of these two audio features on a song's popularity.

### Statistical Analysis:

- Correlation analysis suggests a moderate positive correlation between danceability and streams, while valence exhibits a weak positive correlation.
- Hypothesis tests were conducted to assess the significance of these correlations, providing insights into the relationships.

## Predictive Modeling:

The Random Forest predictive model effectively captures the relationships between audio features and song popularity on the music streaming platform. The strong performance and insights gained from feature importance contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing a song's popularity.
No predictive modeling was performed in this analysis.

## Insights and Conclusions:

### Key Findings:

- Songs with higher danceability tend to attract more streams.
- While valence also plays a role, its impact on popularity is less pronounced.
- The 'interaction' feature reveals interesting patterns, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple audio features together.

### Limitations:

- The analysis is limited to available data and assumes that streaming metrics are indicative of a song's popularity.
- The absence of certain features, such as explicit lyrics or genre, may impact the comprehensiveness of the analysis.

### Recommendations:

- Further investigation into the impact of additional features, such as explicit content or genre, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of song popularity.
- Ongoing monitoring of emerging trends in audio features and streaming metrics is recommended to adapt to evolving listener preferences.
